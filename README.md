# Diegesis Movie Maker Plugin
## Overview
The Diegesis Movie Maker plugin for Unreal Engine addresses a critical limitation in the engine's timeline and sequence editing capabilities. Traditionally, these functionalities have been restricted to the editor environment, limiting the ability of developers to create dynamic and interactive sequences during gameplay. This plugin aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive suite of tools for timeline editing directly within the game environment.

## Key Features
- Enables the creation, modification, and deletion of possessables, tracks, blocks, keyframes, and more during gameplay.
- All functionalities are accessible as blueprint nodes, ensuring seamless integration into existing projects.
- Compatible with both Unreal Engine 4 and 5, with a focus on maintaining optimal functionality for Unreal Engine 5.

## Usage
1. Install the Diegesis Movie Maker plugin into your Unreal Engine project.
2. Access the blueprint nodes provided by the plugin to implement dynamic timeline editing functionality in your game.
3. Test and iterate on your sequences directly within the game environment to achieve the desired cinematic effects and storytelling.
